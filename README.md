# Monte Carlo simulations of AF spin textures observed in CuMnAs.
## Written by O. J. Amin, correspondence: Oliver.Amin@nottingham.ac.uk

Script 'AFDW' written in MATLAB (version R2020b). Requires Image Processing toolbox available in MATLAB add-ons, as well as BREWERMAP function (https://github.com/DrosteEffect/BrewerMap).

The simulation uses Monte Carlo methods to find the local energy minima of a target topological antiferromagnetic spin texture state, as observed in CuMnAs. The user can choose between three target states; a simple 180degree antiferromagnetic domain wall with two points of chirality reversal; a single domain wall loop with two points of chirality reversal; and a double domain wall loop with four points of chirality reversal.
